# gfxcore2
C++ wrapper lib for the original Delphi-based tmcsgfxlib which was used by the legacy PR00FPS made in 2007.

I wrote this wrapper lib in 2019 in order to be able to run the old Delphi-based legacy PR00FPS with my NEW C++ -based graphics engine (PURE) without the need of any modification of the original code of PR00FPS.

This wrapper lib is sitting in between legacy PR00FPS and the new PURE graphics engine, mimicing the behavior of the old Delphi-based tmcsgfxlib2 graphics library towards PR00FPS.

The source of the original tmcsgfxlib written in Delphi can be checked here:

The source of the new PURE graphics library (part of PGE game engine) can be checked here:
